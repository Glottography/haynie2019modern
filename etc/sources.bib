  abstract    = {Research regarding the ecology and evolution of languages has advanced rapidly in recent years, increasing demand for digital spatial location data for individual languages. However, language mapping and geographic information system (GIS) data creation has not kept pace with this demand. To date, language range information is typically contained in small, private regional datasets, paper maps and published illustrations, or in a very small number of global digital datasets. Each of these sources has advantages and disadvantages, and though these considerations may not be apparent to all data users, they can have significant impacts on research results. Mapping of language ranges is a particularly complex problem in regions where colonial histories have had dramatic effects on language diversity, language locations, and the relative representation of colonial and indigenous perspectives. Here we consider how the creation of digital language range data can better meet the needs of researchers interested in language diversity, discuss how better standards for data quality and transparency can be implemented for digital language range maps, and present a map of North American language ranges that has resulted from the use of these procedures and standards.},
